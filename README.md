I created this project for people that wants to moves from your current version of Actionbar to the new Material Design Toolbar.

In the example you will find an Activity with an Actionbar with several actions like a Search widget. Finally, I created a new Acitivity with a Toolbar configured that uses the same manu an actions. I also set the Styles according Material Design roules.
